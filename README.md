# Pandas-challenge
In this repository, I've created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

My objective is to analyze and help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

To begin, I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results by leveraging student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 

Within the PyCitySchools folder, you will be able to access my overall analysis(PyCity_Report.txt), the starter code provided(PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb), my code(main.ipynb), and 'Resources' folder containing the raw data(schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv)
